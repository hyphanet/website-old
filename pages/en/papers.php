	  <a href="/papers/freenet-0.7.5-paper.pdf">The Dark Freenet</a> (PDF)<br/>
	  Detailed paper about the Freenet 0.7.5 network, as opposed to its routing algorithm, which is detailed in the
	  below papers. Includes some new simulations. This has been submitted to PET 2010.

	  <a href="/22c3vid.html">Video of Small World talk, Berlin, December 2005</a><br/>
	  This is a video of a talk given by Ian Clarke and Oskar
	  Sandberg at the Chaos Computer Congress in Berlin, December
	  2005, describing the (then) new architecture for Freenet
	  0.7.  You can also download
	  the <a href="/papers/ccc/ccc-slideshow.pdf.bz2">slideshow</a>,
	  and the source for the Java <a href="/papers/ccc/ccc-freenet-demo.tar.bz2">demo</a> 
	  (requires Java 1.5).

	  <a href="/papers/lic.pdf">Searching in a Small World</a> (PDF)<br/>
	  Oskar Sandberg's licentiate thesis describing a simple decentralized mechanism for constructing small world
	  networks that is inspired by Freenet's original design.  Part II of the thesis describes the basis for
	  the new Darknet architecture.

	  <a href="/papers/swroute.pdf">Distributed routing in Small World Networks</a> (PDF)<br/>
	  A paper by Oskar Sandberg describing the theoretical basis for the new "Darknet" routing mechanism employed
	  by Freenet 0.7.

	  <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2005/fahrplan/events/492.en.html">Chaos Computer Congress Talk</a> 
	  (slideshow)<br/>
	  This is a <a href="/papers/ccc/ccc-slideshow.pdf.bz2">slideshow</a> for a talk given 
	  at the Chaos Computer Congress on 30th Dec 2005 in Berlin, Germany by Ian 
	  Clarke and Oskar Sandberg.  It described the new "darknet" approach to be employed in Freenet 0.7.  A Java 
	  demonstration to accompany the talk is <a href="/papers/ccc/ccc-freenet-demo.tar.bz2">also</a> available.

	  A paper describing some attacks on Freenet 0.7's location swapping algorithm.

	  <a href="/ngrouting.html">Next Generation Routing Algorithm</a><br/>
	  This article describes Freenet's "Next Generation" routing algorithm.  This was a novel
	  approach which had nodes making routing decisions based on sophisticated analysis of
	  the time required to route previous requests.  This algorithm was promising, but
	  was eventually dropped in favour of a much simpler approach in Freenet 0.7.

	  <a href="/papers/freenet-ieee.pdf">Protecting Freedom of Information 
	    Online with Freenet</a> (PDF)<br/>
	  An IEEE Internet Computing article describing the Freenet architecture 
	  circa 2002 - probably the best introduction to the theory behind 
	  Freenet.

	  The most up to date reference is of course <a href="/developer.html">the source code</a>, but
	  there is also some useful documentation on <a href="https://wiki.freenetproject.org/">the wiki</a>
	  (you may have to search a bit), and most implemented ideas have been discussed in detail on
	  <a href="/lists.html">the mailing lists</a> at some point, or 
	  <a href="https://bugs.freenetproject.org/">the bug tracker</a>.

	  And an unofficial, more
	  elaborate <a href="http://www.freenethelp.org">Freenet Help

	  newbies may have about the usage and  inner-workings of
	  Freenet.
